# 👥 Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning** techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. Customer segmentation helps businesses personalize marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize sales strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

- Segment customers into distinct groups based on behavior or features.
- Use clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify patterns in customer data.
- Visualize clusters for insight and interpretation.

## 📁 Files

- `Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning in Python.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization steps.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation
- **NumPy** – For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For visualizations
- **Scikit-learn** – For clustering and preprocessing

## 🔍 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Feature Scaling / Standardization**
4. **K-Means Clustering**
5. **Optimal Cluster Selection (Elbow Method / Silhouette Score)**
6. **Cluster Visualization**
7. **Business Interpretation of Segments**

## 📈 Example Output

- Visuals like:
  - Elbow Plot to determine optimal number of clusters
  - 2D/3D Scatter Plots of customer segments
- Example segments:
  - High-spending, low-frequency buyers
  - Frequent, budget-conscious shoppers

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo or download the notebook.**
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
