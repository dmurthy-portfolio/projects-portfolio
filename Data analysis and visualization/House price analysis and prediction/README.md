# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Train regression models to predict housing prices.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE and R².
- Visualize insights and prediction results.

## 📁 Files

- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the full workflow — from data cleaning to model evaluation.
